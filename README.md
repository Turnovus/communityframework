The Community Framework is a collaborative framework, providing functionality to be used in mods for RimWorld. The aim of the Community Framework is to serve as a public repository for experienced modders to share their work, so that less-experienced modders working primarily within XML can benefit from their contributions.

## Using the Framework
Anyone is permitted to create and share mods depending on the Community Framework at any time and without any prior notice, as long as the mod does not violate RimWorld's Terms of Service.
When uploading mods to the Steam Workshop, simply listing the Community Framework as a dependency is acceptable. When sharing dependent mods via other sources, such as Nexus Mods, we ask that you provide a link to this GitHub repository.
Currently, the only official channels to access the Framework are through this GitHub repository, and through Steam Workshop.

## Contributing to the Framework
Anyone is welcome to submit code to the Community Framework for review. However, due to the nature of the Framework, the specifics of this process are subject to change. For more information, please view the [Wiki page on adding your code](https://github.com/ISOR3X/communityframework/wiki/Adding-your-code).
